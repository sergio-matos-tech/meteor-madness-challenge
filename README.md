# Meteor Madness

## The Problem

The discovery of near-Earth asteroids highlights the ongoing risk of celestial objects colliding with our planet. Asteroid impacts, though rare, could cause widespread devastation, including tsunamis, seismic events, and atmospheric changes.
NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide vast datasets on asteroids and Earth's geology, but this information is not well-integrated, making it difficult to model impact scenarios, predict the consequences, and evaluate strategies to mitigate the risks.

The Lobotomia Soluções team has taken it upon themselves to create an interactive visualization and simulation tool that uses real data to:

* Model asteroid impact scenarios.
* Predict the consequences of an impact, such as tsunamis, seismic events, and atmospheric changes.
* Evaluate potential mitigation strategies.

The tool should be user-friendly and accessible to scientists and the general public. It should bridge the gap between complex scientific data and actionable insights, helping to improve public understanding and spreading awareness of the risks posed by near-Earth objects.
